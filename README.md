# Swapi Box

## Overview:

Swapi Box is a solo project to gain more experience building React components, creating multiple Fetch API calls, and utilizing Redux. I hit the [The Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/documentation) to compile Star Wars information for the user. You can toggle between sections for People, Planets, and Vehicles related to Star Wars.
